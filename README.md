# 🎯 Aim and Claim – Hack Assembly Game (Nand2Tetris)

**Aim and Claim** is a classic-style 2D shooting game written in the Hack Assembly language as part of the [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) project. Built to demonstrate low-level system understanding and creative logic design, this game challenges players to shoot objects and solve math puzzles — all within the constraints of the Hack computer.

## 🕹 Game Overview

You play as the shooter in a timed arcade-style challenge. The objective is simple: **aim**, **shoot**, and **claim points**!

### 🎯 Level Structure

#### Level 1: Static Targets
- Shoot as many static objects as possible within **60 seconds**.
- Each hit gives you points.

#### Level 2 Trigger: Math Challenge
- After 60 seconds, you must answer a **math question**.
  - ✅ Correct Answer → +100 points  
  - ❌ Incorrect Answer → -1 life

#### Level 2: Moving Targets
- Survive and shoot **dynamic/moving objects**.
- Precision and timing are everything.

#### Game End:
